title: "Passing the ENARSI"
---

Last month I sat the enarsi exam and while i was able to pass the exam on my first attempt, I still consider it the hardest exam I have every taken. I have been study for Cisco exams for almost 3 years at this point passing my CCNA in 2023, and then doing the ENCOR early 2025, quickly followed up the ENCC, and the finally the ENARSI the end of 2025. 

I am going to give a brief overview of the materials that I used to study for this exam and some of the techniques and habit thats enabled me to pass it.
