### CCNP ENARSI Exam Experience and Study Resources

Last month, I sat for the CCNP ENARSI (300-410) exam. Although I passed on my first attempt, I still consider it the hardest Cisco exam I have taken. I’ve been studying for Cisco certifications off and on for over three years: I passed my CCNA in early 2023, followed by the ENCOR (350-401) in early 2025, then the ENCC, and finally the ENARSI at the end of 2025.

In this post, I’ll walk through how I studied for the ENARSI exam, the resources I used, and what to expect from the exam itself. If you’re preparing for the CCNP ENARSI, I hope this helps you focus your efforts and avoid common pitfalls.

### ENARSI Study Resources

The largest portion of the exam covers Layer 3 Technologies. To tackle this, I started with Nick Russo’s 10-week ENARSI study plan and a subscription to Pluralsight. This study plan is quite intensive, almost like drinking from a fire hose, and I couldn’t keep up with the exact timeline. However, Nick Russo’s courses and the study plan are excellent resources, best used as a recap after you’ve grasped the basics of each topic. Because of this, I eventually got a subscription to INE to revisit and deepen my understanding of the more challenging concepts. I also used the Official Cert Guide (OCG) from Cisco to fill in any gaps.

For VPN Technologies, I needed additional resources for topics like DMVPN and MPLS, which I hadn’t previously worked with. For DMVPN, I relied heavily on INE and combined that with Nick Russo’s coverage. For MPLS, I found a fantastic YouTube series by Lazarus on the "telecomTech" channel, and I followed his MPLS series and completed all the labs he presented. I also used the OCG to cross-reference my learning.

When it came to Infrastructure Security and Infrastructure Services, I mainly used INE and the OCG. Additionally, I work daily with Cisco Catalyst Center and a full Cisco stack at my job, which helped reinforce these concepts. Don’t skip these sections — there’s a lot about device management and securing your devices.

Lastly, I did a lot of labs. I completed most of the labs suggested by Nick Russo on GNS3Vault, as well as labs from telecomTech. I performed labs whenever I didn’t fully understand a concept.

I also want to make a note that I used CLaude alot for varius task like making lab topologies, Repharing somthing that I did not understand and giving practical examples. While not allows %100 correcct i found it make faster then using google.

### CCNP ENARSI Exam Experience

The ENARSI exam begins with four hands-on labs, each containing multiple objectives. These labs cover a wide range of technologies but closely follow the official exam blueprint. If the blueprint states you need to know how to configure something, you should be prepared to configure it accurately and efficiently.

After the labs, the exam transitions into multiple-choice questions. These questions also align well with the blueprint and span a broad range of topics. At times, I found myself narrowing answers down to two seemingly correct options, but overall the questions were fair and well-structured.

I used nearly the full 90 minutes and had to move quickly through the final questions to ensure everything was answered. While this was the most difficult Cisco exam I’ve taken, it was also the most enjoyable. The exam felt challenging, fair, and well-designed, and it genuinely tested real-world networking skills.
