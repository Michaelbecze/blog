title: "Passing the ENARSI"
---
Last month, I sat for the ENARSI exam. Although I passed on my first attempt, I still consider it the hardest exam I have ever taken. I’ve been studying for Cisco exams for nearly three years now: I passed my CCNA in 2023, followed by the ENCOR in early 2025, then the ENCC, and finally the ENARSI at the end of 2025.

In this post, I’ll give an overview of the materials I used to study for the ENARSI exam, as well as the techniques and habits that helped me succeed.

The largest portion of the exam covers Layer 3 Technologies. To tackle this, I started with Nick Russo’s 10-week ENARSI study plan and a subscription to Pluralsight. This study plan is quite intensive, almost like drinking from a fire hose, and I couldn’t keep up with the exact timeline. However, Nick Russo’s courses and the study plan are excellent resources, best used as a recap after you’ve grasped the basics of each topic. Because of this, I eventually got a subscription to INE to revisit and deepen my understanding of the more challenging concepts. I also used the Official Cert Guide (OCG) from Cisco to fill in any gaps.

For VPN Technologies, I needed additional resources for topics like DMVPN and MPLS, which I hadn’t previously worked with. For DMVPN, I relied heavily on INE and combined that with Nick Russo’s coverage. For MPLS, I found a fantastic YouTube series by Lazarus on the "telecomTech" channel, and I followed his MPLS series and completed all the labs he presented. I also used the OCG to cross-reference my learning.

When it came to Infrastructure Security and Infrastructure Services, I mainly used INE and the OCG. Additionally, I work daily with Cisco Catalyst Center and a full Cisco stack at my job, which helped reinforce these concepts. Don’t skip these sections — there’s a lot about device management and securing your devices.

Lastly, I did a lot of labs. I completed most of the labs suggested by Nick Russo on GNS3Vault, as well as labs from telecomTech. I performed labs whenever I didn’t fully understand a concept.
