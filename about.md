Hi, I’m Michael — a network engineer with a passion for building, troubleshooting, and explaining complex infrastructure.

This blog is where I share what I’m currently working on, studying, and learning as I continue to grow in the field. Some posts are deep technical dives, others are lab notes or ideas I’m still working through, but all of it reflects real experience and curiosity about how networks actually behave.

If you’re interested in enterprise networking, routing and switching, or the details that live beyond the CLI, you’re in the right place.
